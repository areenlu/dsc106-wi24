# Final Project

The final project will provide hands-on experience designing, implementing, and deploying interactive visualizations. Your project should address a concrete visualization challenge and should propose a novel, creative solution. The final deliverable will take the form of an explorable explanation, deployed as an interactive web page. Project teams should consist of 3-4 people.

In addition to your webpage, you will be responsible for presenting your final results. At the end of the quarter we will have a video showcase for you to share your work.

Prior to diving in, it is helpful to gain a sense of what goes into formulating a successful visualization project and to beware of common pitfalls. We encourage you to read [A Nested Model for Visualization Design and Validation by Tamara Munzner][link].

## Theme: Explorable Explanations

Your task is to create an Explorable Explanation: an interactive article that explains a complex subject to the reader. The topic could be a scientific phenomenon, a computer science algorithm, a mathematical concept, a sociological theory, or some other topic that you're passionate about. Focus on creating one or more interactive diagrams interlinked with explanatory text or annotations. We urge you to focus on a highly visual and/or interactive experience, as opposed to expecting a viewer to read large amounts of article text.

## Project Milestones

The final project consists of the following milestones:

- Proposal (Fri 02/23, 11:59pm). Propose your chosen topic, dataset(s), and team members. Complete the registration form (one per team, [Registration Link][link8]).

- Initial Prototype (Fri 03/01, 11:59pm). Develop an initial prototype of your project and, similar to Project 3, publish it using GitHub pages. This prototype will be used by the course staff to provide feedback on your designs. It is expected that your project will not yet be in a "complete" state; however, by this point you should have the structure of your project laid out, rough prototypes of your main visualization(s) and interactions, and at least basic descriptive text. Each team should submit the URL for their project on Gradescope.

- Demo Video (Fri 03/08, 11:59pm). You must produce a demo video (not to exceed 2 minutes in length) that introduces and explains your project. Your video can take the form of a narrated demo of your project, and may include additional content as you see fit. We will share the videos in class on 03/14. More information about preparing the video is available in the project deliverables section.

- Deliverables (Sat 03/16, 11:59pm). Publish your final project web page. You may make final touches to your page after any feedback from our video session. More information about preparing the final deliverables is available in the project deliverables section.

Your video should be posted to YouTube, and a URL to your video must be submitted via Gradescope by Fri 03/08. The links for the complete version of your final project webpage should be submitted on Gradescope by Sat 03/16.

## Project Deliverables

To complete your final project, you must provide two primary deliverables:

- A demonstration video (<= 2 minutes in length) that communicates your project goals and visualizations. YouTube URL due on Gradescope by 11:59pm, Fri 03/08.
- An interactive visualization web page for your chosen topic. Code and website due on Gradescope by 11:59pm, Sat 03/16.

### Online Visualization

Your final project visualizations must be published on GitHub pages. For your visualizations you need to utilize D3.js. Keep your source code (HTML markup, visualization JavaScript code, etc.) in the top-level of your GitLab repo. When ready to publish, place all necessary files in the "docs" subfolder to publish on GitHub pages.

### Video Presentation

In addition to your interactive web page, each team must produce a short demonstration video (no longer than 2 minutes!) introducing your project. Your video must communicate the specific topic and goals of your project along with your visualization designs. We expect most videos will use a mixture of static slides and interactive screen capture with overlaid narration. You might consider showing your web page as published on the web. Alternatively, you might create a stripped down version that removes text in favor of spoken narration, bringing more focus and screen space to your visualizations. The initial frame of your video should include your project name and the team members' names.

Be sure that your video communicates how your visualization designs enable a better understanding of your chosen data. Do not simply enumerate the various features you implemented: focus on what viewers can learn from your visualization(s).

Please carefully read the [video production guide][link9] for details on how to design and record your video. Your videos should be in MPEG4 (.mp4, .m4v) format. Use appropriate compression to ensure your video file is not unnecessarily large. You will post videos online, so we encourage you to put your best face forward to the world!

Your demo video must be published on YouTube. In addition you must submit a URL linking to your video via Gradescope by Fri 03/08, 11:59pm. We will have a video showcase during our last lecture session on Thu 03/14.
