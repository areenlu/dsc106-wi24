# Project 3: Interactive Visualization : Rubric

The assignment is out of 10 points possible. Submissions that squarely meet the project requirements (Satisfactory column) will get 9/10 points.

| Component                  | Excellent                                                                                                                                                             | Satisfactory                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Poor                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Visual Encodings           | The visualization does not violate the expressiveness criteria and the design choices (marks and encoding channels) are clear, evocative, and effective. (+3 points)  | The visualization does not violate the expressiveness criteria, but another set of design choices (marks and encoding channels) could have been more effective (e.g. using the area visual channel instead of position when possible). (+2.5 points)              | The visualization violates the expressiveness criteria (e.g. heavy overplotting, encodings that imply incorrect readings, etc.), and these violations are not addressed using the available interactions (e.g. overplotting that cannot be filtered or zoomed into).  (+1.5 points) |
| Data Transformations       |                                                                                                                                                                       | The visualization uses appropriate data transformations (e.g. filtering, aggregating) and clearly describes the transformations to the reader (e.g. in the subtitle of the plot). (+1.5 points)                                                                   | The visualization used an inappropriate set of data transformations (e.g. filtering out important outliers), or did not clearly describe these transformations to the reader. (+1 point)                                                                                            |
| Interaction                | The interactive elements of the plot are polished, mostly bug-free, and enable the reader to discover interesting patterns in the data. (+3.5 points)                 | The interactive elements of the plot are functional and enable the reader to discover interesting patterns in the data, but a static plot (perhaps with a different encoding) could have conveyed the same information just as effectively. (+3 points)           | The plot would have been substantially more effective as a static plot without the interaction; or, the interaction has major bugs that preclude use. (+2 point)                                                                                                                    |
| Writeup                    |                                                                                                                                                                       | The writeup clearly describes the motivation for the visualization and the rationale for its design decisions (e.g. the visual encodings, data transformations, color palette, etc.). It also contains an overview of the team‚Äôs development process. (+2 points) | One or more required elements of the writeup has major issues (e.g. rationale misses important parts of the visualization design) or is missing. (+1 points)                                                                                                                        |
| Creativity and Originality | The submission exceeds the assignment requirements, with original insights or particularly engaging visualizations. (+1 bonus point)                                  | The submission meets the assignment requirements. (+0 points)                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
